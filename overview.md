-  Cyrus the Great founded The Achaemenid Persian Empire, and practiced **religious and cultural toleration** to maintain order.
- Darius the Great further expanded the empire and introduced reforms such as standard currency and satraps—provincial governors—to rule over smaller regions of the empire on his behalf.
- Darius introduced a standard currency—a gold coin known as a daric.
- Royal Road
- The increased wealth and power of the empire allowed Darius to construct a brand new capital city, called Persepolis.
- The Achaemenid Empire fell under Alexander the Great.

> "There is no nation which so readily adopts foreign customs as the Persians. Thus, they have taken the dress of the Medes, considering it superior to their own; and in war they wear the Egyptian breastplate. As soon as they hear of any luxury, they instantly make it their own."
--- Herodotus, Histories 440 BCE.

:::tip
In ancient Mesopotamia, a common imperial strategy was to relocate conquered populations to new areas in order to break up their political and cultural unity and make them less dangerous to the ruling power. Cyrus reversed this practice by allowing the Jews, who had been relocated by the Babylonians, to return to Israel and establish a tributary state.

# Ancient Greece
![Screen Shot 2021-09-23 at 10.21.32 PM.png](https://boostnote.io/api/teams/wE89btYff/files/21814125f20f57ba9197ca9b470c5d46c52b9c1b778da4d428218af3b42815cd-Screen%20Shot%202021-09-23%20at%2010.21.32%20PM.png)
## City States (Poleis)
Self governed. Without a powerful, centralized state, smaller governing bodies created political order. One such type of governing body was the city-state or polis. Over time, poleis became urban centers whose power and influence extended to the surrounding agricultural regions, which provided resources and paid taxes.

Different city-states practice different government structure: By around 800 BCE, there were many poleis which functioned independently. Each city-state created a different form of governance, ranging from monarchies and oligarchies to militaristic societies and proto-democracies. Monarchies were sometimes ruled by a tyrant—a ruler who did not follow any set laws. Oligarchies were small groups of powerful individuals who ran city-state government. Oligarchs and tyrants often competed for power. Democracies were governments that allowed citizens to vote on and participate in making state decisions.

Important city-states: Some of the most important city-states were Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth, and Delphi. Athens was a democracy and Sparta had two kings and an oligarchic system, but both were important in the development of Greek society and culture.

:::note
Women in Sparta had more rights than women in other Greek city-states. In Sparta, they could own property. Women eventually controlled nearly half of Spartan land. Spartan women could move around with reasonable freedom, wear non-constricting clothing, enjoy athletics, and even drink wine.
:::

## Political Philosophy 
Inequality of wealth: Athens transitioned through different systems of government as wealth became increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few members of the aristocracy, who were also political leaders.

Draco's laws: The first series of laws written to address these inequities was provided by the statesman Draco around 621 BCE, but the laws were considered too severe—the penalty for most infractions was death! 

Solon reforms in 594 BCE: An aristocrat named Solon was called upon to modify and revise these harsh laws; he created a series of laws which equalized political power. Two of the changes for which Solon was responsible were the cancellation of debts and the abolition of debt slavery. He also created opportunities for some common people to participate in the government of Athens. In doing so, Solon laid the groundwork for democracy in Athens.

Pericles and golden age: Pericles led Athens between 461 and 429 BCE; he was an incredibly well-liked leader known for encouraging culture, philosophy, and science and for advocating for the common people. Under Pericles, Athens entered its golden age and great thinkers, writers, and artists flourished in the city. Herodotus—the “father of history”—lived and wrote in Athens. Socrates—the “father of philosophy”—taught in the marketplace. Hippocrates—“the father of medicine”—practiced there. The sculptor Phidias created his great works for the Parthenon on the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Democritus envisioned an atomic universe. Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Sophocles wrote their famous plays. This legacy continued as, later, Plato founded his Academy outside the walls of Athens in 385 BCE and, even later, Aristotle's Lyceum was founded in the city center.

Limited democracy: Still, Athenian democracy was limited to its male citizens. Foreigners, enslaved people, and women were excluded from these institutions. Women’s roles were largely confined to the private sphere, where they were responsible for raising children and managing the household, including enslaved people if the household could afford them. While women of the upper classes were often literate, most were not likely to receive an education beyond what was needed for the execution of their domestic duties. They required male chaperones to travel in public.

Slavery: Enslaved people, while not involved in political affairs, were integral to the Athenian economy. They cultivated food, worked large construction projects, and labored in mines and quarries. Enslaved people were present in most Athenian households, carrying out an array of domestic duties.

### Greek Life
Greeks are religious. 

In Greek society, men were the most powerful group. Women, children, enslaved people, freed people, labourers, and foreigners—could make up as much as 90 percent of the total polis population. 

How to make everyone happy: One way of doing this was to create a sense of solidarity by fostering a social identity that differentiated the polis from all others. This identity was achieved in various ways, such as the creation of a communal space where people could mix and socialize—the agora. Polis-specific festivals and celebrations on specific dates in the year—usually of a religious nature— reinforced the idea that the polis had a unique, often mythical, founder and patron deity.

Literature and theatre: which were very intertwined, were important in ancient Greek society. Greek theatre began in the sixth century BCE in Athens with the performance of tragedy plays at religious festivals. These, in turn, inspired the genre of Greek comedy plays.

Sculpture and architecture

### Legacy
> "Captive Greece took captive her fierce conqueror and instilled her arts in rustic Latium."

Via the Roman Empire, Greek culture came to be foundational to Western culture in general. The Byzantine Empire inherited Classical Greek culture directly, without Latin intermediation, and the preservation of classical Greek learning in medieval Byzantine tradition exerted strong influence on the Slavs and later on the Islamic Golden Age and the Western European Renaissance. A modern revival of Classical Greek learning took place in the Neoclassicism movement in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe and the Americas.


## Greek Colonization
![Greek Colonization.png](https://boostnote.io/api/teams/wE89btYff/files/266efcab3be880d3fcea482a3516133871c82f0ef673074b3a7eaf4e6d2550c0-Greek%20Colonization.png)

Greek language and culture spread throughout the region. However, it also brought conflict and tensions with the Persian empire, inaugurating the two-decade long Persian Wars from 500 to 479 BCE. As Persia consolidated its control over its conquests in Anatolia, Greek communities living in that area, called Ionia, resisted Persian rule. To support the Ionian Greeks, the Athenians sent their impressive fleet, which prompted retribution from the Persians. The ensuing conflict drew in other Greek city-states, most notably, Sparta. Conflict between the Greeks and Persians continued for over 100 years.

## Greco-Persian War
First Persian invasion ended by war of marathon. 

During second invasion, Athens was burned and old Acropolis destroyed (Athenians evacuated beforehand). 

After defeating Persian at Plataea, Themistocles oversaw the re-fortification of Athens. Pericles oversaw the building of great monuments and buildings such as the Statue of Athena and the Parthenon.

![Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 3.18.17 PM.png](https://boostnote.io/api/teams/wE89btYff/files/4f577991d0b2108c9d7cec87c70d8e0548adb1f7139386dcfecfa4813548671b-Screen%20Shot%202021-09-25%20at%203.18.17%20PM.png)
Strong Athens (Delian league, naval supremacy): Though the Greek city-states were unified to some extent in the face of an external threat, as that threat waned, conflicts between the city-states made a resurgence. Following the wars, Athens emerged as the supreme naval power in Greece. It formed the Delian League, ostensibly to create a cohesive Greek network among city-states to ward off further Persian attacks. Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens grew so powerful that the Athenian Empire could effectively dictate the laws, customs, and trade of all her neighbors in Attica and the islands of the Aegean.

Arrogance and war: The might of the Athenian Empire encouraged an arrogance in Athenian policy makers of the day which grew intolerable to the other city-states. When Athens sent troops to help Sparta put down a Helot rebellion, the Spartans refused the gesture and sent the Athenian force back home in dishonor, thus provoking the war which had long been brewing. Later, when Athens sent their fleet to help defend its ally Cocyra—Corfu—against a Corinthian invasion during the Battle of Sybota in 433 BCE, their action was interpreted by Sparta as aggression instead of assistance, as Corinth was an ally of Sparta.

Sparta victory and decline of Athens: The Peloponnesian War—which took place between 431 and 404 BCE between Athens and Sparta, though it involved directly or indirectly all of Greece—ended in disaster for Athens when it was defeated. 

Rebuild Athens: Since the loss of the war was largely blamed on democratic politicians such as Cleon and Cleophon, there was a brief reaction against democracy, aided by the Spartan army (the rule of the Thirty Tyrants). In 403 BC, however, democracy was restored by Thrasybulus and an amnesty was declared.

Alexander (age 32) died at 323 BCE at Babylon. 

### Alexandria
Alexander founded some 20 cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris River. The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become an important Mediterranean urban center. 

At first, the cities must have been inhospitable and little more than defensive garrisons. Alexander’s cities were most likely intended to be administrative headquarters for his empire. 

The purpose of these administrative centers was to control the newly conquered subject populations. Alexander attempted to create a unified ruling class in conquered territories like Persia, often using marriage ties to intermingle the conquered with conquerors. He also adopted elements of the Persian court culture, implementing his own version of their royal robes and imitating some court ceremonies. Many Macedonians resented these policies, believing hybridization of Greek and foreign cultures to be irreverent. Alexander’s attempts at unification also extended to his army. He placed Persian soldiers, some of who had been trained in the Macedonian style, within Macedonian ranks, solving chronic manpower problems.

## The Roman Republic
**A Very complex system:**
During the Republican period of Rome, political offices and institutions were designed to prevent any one man from becoming too powerful. These systems began to break down in the first century BCE.

**Start:** The Republic began in 509 BCE when a group of noblemen overthrew the last king of Rome. The Romans replaced the king with two consuls—rulers who had many of the same powers as the king but were elected to serve one-year terms. Each consul could veto the actions of the other consul. The idea is to prevent any one man from becoming too powerful.

Roman society was divided into two classes: the patricians, wealthy elites, and the plebeians, the common people.

**More political opportunities for plebeians**: Initially, only the patricians were able to hold political office and make important decisions. To become a senator, a Roman had to have held a political office, and plebeians could not. Between 494 and 287 BCE, new political offices for plebeians were created and access to higher office, including the consulship, was opened to them. Voting assemblies and councils were established that gave plebeians more say in the politics of Rome. In 287 BCE, a law removed the last barrier to plebeian political participation by abolishing the requirement that proposed laws had to be approved by patrician senators before the Plebeian Council could consider them.

**Voting system**: One reason that political rights did not lead to major changes was that the Comitia Centuriata—the main voting assembly that elected consuls and other important officials—was organized based on wealth. Each century had one vote, but the wealthy were split into smaller groups than the poor, giving the vote of a wealthy Roman more influence.

**Reason behind wealth-based voting power**: Men were divided into classes based on their wealth because soldiers had to provide their own equipment. Only wealthy Romans could afford high-quality weapons and armor. Men without property were not eligible for military service. Part of the reason that the Romans saw no problem with allowing the wealthy to have greater political influence was because they believed that those who had the most wealth also had the most to lose from Roman defeat.

### Foreign policy and expansion
Tolerance policy: The Romans did not set out any deliberate plan to build an empire nor try to turn everyone they conquered into a Roman. For the most part, cities and regions that came under Roman control were allowed to maintain their existing cultural and political institutions. The only major requirement that Rome imposed on its defeated enemies was that they provide soldiers for military campaigns. In the ancient world, military victory usually meant a share of the loot taken from the conquered, so participating on the winning side of a conflict offered incentives to Rome’s new allies.

Citizenship for conquered city: Most conquered enemies were offered some level of Roman citizenship, sometimes with full voting rights. Because a person had to be physically present in Rome to vote, the extension of voting rights beyond the population of the city itself did not drastically alter the political situation in Rome. However, the offer of citizenship did help to build a sense of shared identity around loyalty to Rome.

Governor: In order to manage the new territories that came under their influence, the Romans created formal provinces and appointed former political officeholders to manage them. Given the distance between most provinces and Rome, these governors often had considerable power and flexibility in dealing with local issues. The Romans tried to create a balance between giving governors enough power to control their provinces and preventing governors from becoming so powerful that they could challenge Rome’s authority.

#### Marcus Licinius Crassus
(/ˈkræsəs/ 115 – 53 BC) often called "the richest man in Rome."

Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war. Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey the Great.

Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar's spectacular successes in the Gallic Wars. Following his second consulship, Crassus was appointed as the governor of Roman Syria. Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire. Crassus died at the battle of Carrhae.

## Augustus's Rome
- The Roman Empire began in 27 BCE when Augustus became the sole ruler of Rome.
- Augustus never took the title of king or emperor, nor did his successors; they preferred to call themselves princeps, first citizen, or primus inter pares, first among peers.
- Beginning with Augustus, emperors built far more monumental structures, which transformed the city of Rome.

Pax Romana—literally “Roman peace”—is a term often given to the period between 27 BCE and 180 CE during which Roman rule was relatively stable and war less frequent.

Political control: The emperors and the Senate took over most elections and simply chose who they wanted for office, so there were fewer elected political offices to fight over.

Military control: Augustus took control as the stand-in governor of the most dangerous Roman provinces, where the majority of the Roman legions were stationed. This was a clever move because it gave Augustus control of the army while at the same time making it appear that he was doing a favor to the people of Rome.

Coin and power: Under the empire, Roman currency was not just an economic tool; it was a political tool, as well. Julius Caesar had been the first Roman to put his own portrait on coins, and Augustus continued this practice. Placing the current emperor’s portrait on coins reinforced the connection between economic power and the emperor, and also helped to shape the popular image of the emperor among the Roman people. Emperors would also use imagery on coins to popularize other family members, political allies, and especially their chosen heirs.

Infrastructure: Augustus made permanent the positions of those who oversaw the construction and maintenance of these projects, which helped improve accountability.

:::note
Although Augustus fundamentally reorganized the way the Roman state functioned, few ordinary Romans experienced much change in their daily lives. Augustus’s reforms made little difference to social and economic structures. Although his massive building projects and increased foreign trade brought goods, knowledge, and entertainment to the Roman people, these changes can be viewed as the Roman people swapping their old patrician patrons for the emperor. That is, the emperor became the patron of all Romans.

> "After the establishment of one-man rule at the end of the first century BCE, for more than two hundred years there is no significant history of change at Rome. Autocracy represented, in a sense, an end of history. Of course there were all kind of events, battles, assassinations, political stand-offs, new initiatives and inventions; and the participants would have have all kinds of exciting stories to tell and disputes to argue. But unlike the story of the development of the Republic and the growth of imperial power, which revolutionized almost every aspect of the world of Rome, there was no fundamental change in the structure of Roman politics, empire, or society between the end of the first century BCE and the end of the second century CE."

# ---The World From 200 AD To 1400 AD---
# Transition to the Middle Ages
## Overview of The Byzantine Empire
 - The Byzantine Empire was the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire after the Western Roman Empire's fall in the fifth century CE. It lasted from the fall of the Roman Empire until the Ottoman conquest in 1453.
- Continuities: The Byzantine Empire initially maintained many Roman systems of governance and law and aspects of Roman culture. The Byzantines called themselves "Roman". The term "Byzantine Empire" was not used until well after the fall of the Empire.
- Changes: The Byzantine Empire shifted its capital from Rome to Constantinople, changed the official religion to Christianity, and changed the official language from Latin to Greek.

### Culture
A central feature of Byzantine culture was Orthodox Christianity. Byzantine society was very religious, and it held certain values in high esteem, including a respect for order and traditional hierarchies. Family was at the center of society, and marriage, chastity, and celibacy were celebrated and respected.
Because family was so significant, women and mothers were seen as important members of the family unit, though some women joined monastic orders. 

Eunuchs, men who had been castrated, were also an important part of Byzantine society. They were able to attain high positions in the Byzantine court, in part because they were regarded as trustworthy due to their inability to claim the throne and have descendants.

In addition to the elite classes at the top of society, Byzantine society had numerous social hierarchies among peasants, who were not a homogenous group. The lives of peasants differed greatly depending on whether they owned their own property or were dependent on private or state landowners. Over time, during the fourth to sixth centuries, the number of peasants who held small parcels of land declined, and peasants were increasingly tied to particular land parcels.

## Roman and Byzantium Emperors During Transition
### Constantine I (324 CE to 337 CE)
Constantine moved the capital to Byzantium and changed the religious character of the empire from pagan to Christian. This made it different from the Roman Empire.

### Theodosius I (379 CE to 395 CE)
Last empire to rule over west and east empire. Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire (both East and West).


### Justinian (527 CE to 565 CE)
- Law (Code of Justinian)
- Building (Hagia Sofia)

### Heraclius (610 CE to 641 CE)
- Theme system: switched from the provincial administration system to theme system - land was granted to farmers who, in return, provided the empire with loyal soldiers. Each district was called a theme. The efficiency of this system allowed the empire to keep hold of Asia Minor. The previous system of provinces was a civil administration, but the theme system fused civil administration with military administration. This system was fairly successful. Because there was not enough money to pay soldiers, land grants were able to subsidize the military. Also, soldiers had a personal stake in the land since it was their own.

- Greek replaced Latin as the official language. 
- Instead of an urbanized, cosmopolitan civilization, the Byzantine Empire became an agrarian, military-dominated society caught up in a lengthy struggle with its neighbors.

## Overview of High Middle Ages
### General
Expansion and Spread of Christianity: Byzantine Empire went on the offensive against its enemies and expanded its territory, conquering Crete, Cyprus, and most of Syria. This period saw the conversion of the Bulgarians, Serbs, and Rus to Orthodox Christianity, permanently changing the religious map of Europe and the face of the Byzantine Empire.

Weakened Central Power: Throughout this period, there was great competition among nobles for land in the theme system. Since landowners could collect taxes and control the military forces of their themes, they became independent of the emperors and acted independently. This weakened the authority of the emperors. Landowners tended to increase taxes on small farmers in order to enrich themselves. These increased taxes caused riots and further destabilized an already weakened order.

### Art
During the Byzantine Renaissance—from 867 to 1056—art and literature flourished. Artists adopted a naturalistic style and complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art and mixed them with Christian themes. Byzantine art from this period had a strong influence on the later painters of the Italian Renaissance.

### Religion
The East-West Schism in 1054 divided the Christian world into the Orthodox Church—now the Eastern Orthodox Church—the Catholic Church—now the Roman Catholic Church.

## Fall of Byzantine Empire
Though the situation seemed bleak, the Byzantine Empire survived into the fifteenth century, undergoing more transformations. However, the empire incurred significant territorial losses, and by the time the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire was little more than Constantinople itself.

In the period following the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 and the fall of Constantinople in 1453, people migrated out of Constantinople. Among these emigrants were many Byzantine scholars and artists, including grammarians, poets, writers, musicians, astronomers, architects, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians.

The exodus of these people from Constantinople contributed to the revival of Greek and Roman studies, which led to the development of the Renaissance in humanism and science. Byzantine emigrants also brought to western Europe the better preserved and accumulated knowledge of their own Greek civilization.

### Rashidun Caliphate
Unity among the Arab tribes, partially through the promise of military conquest. However, this unity was tentative and ultimately gave way to major divergences that disrupted state and religious institutions in the coming centuries.

The transition was full of strife. Debates raged about the nature of Islamic leadership and religious authority. These conflicts evolved into major schisms between Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi Islam.


### Umayyad Caliphate
Before the Umayyads, Islamic rule was non-centralized. The military was organized under the caliphate, a political structure led by a caliph, who was regarded as the religious and political successor to the prophet Muhammad.

Umayyads began developing a dynastic and centralized Islamic political state, which were often influenced by the political structures in neighboring empires like the Byzantines and Sasanians.

The Umayyads shifted the capital from Mecca to Syria and replaced tribal traditions with an imperial government controlled by a monarch. They replaced Greek, Persian, and Coptic with Arabic as the main administrative language and reinforced an Arab Islamic identity. Notably, an Arab hierarchy emerged, in which non-Arabs were accorded secondary status. The Umayyads also minted Islamic coins and developed a more sophisticated bureaucracy, in which governors named viziers oversaw smaller political units.

The Umayyads did not actively encourage conversion, and most subjects remained non-Muslim. Because non-Muslim subjects were required to pay a special tax, the Umayyads were able to subsidize their political expansion.

### Abbasids
Based in Damascus, Syria, the Umayyad Caliphate faced internal pressures and resistance, partly because they displayed an obvious preference for Arab Muslims, excluding non-Arab Muslims like Persians. Taking advantage of this weakness, Sunni Arab Abu al-Abbas mounted a revolution in 750 CE. With support from his followers, he destroyed the Umayyad troops in a massive battle and formed the Abbasid Dynasty in its place.

Abbasid leadership was also dynastic and centralized. However, they changed the social hierarchy by constructing a more inclusive government in a more cosmopolitan capital city, Baghdad. The distinction between Arab Muslims and non-Arab Muslims diminished, with Persian culture exerting a greater influence on the Abbasid court.

Under the Abbasids, Islamic art and culture flourished. They are famous for inaugurating the Islamic golden age. Many people converted to Islam, for beliefs including sincere belief and avoiding paying taxes levied on non-Muslims. 

From the ninth century to the twelfth century, Islamic culture flourished and crystallized into what we now recognize as Islam.

### Late-Abbasids
- Towards the end of the Abbasid caliphate, the formerly vast and united Islamic empire became fragmented and decentralized.
- Many different groups ruled areas previously held by the Abbasids.
- Religious institutions became more defined during this period as state power waned.
- Trade contributed to the spread of Islamic culture and led to a growing feeling of internationalism.

By the late Abbasid period, Muslim rule was no longer an Arab phenomenon. Muslim Kurdish, Persian, Turkish, Mongol, and Afghan leaders secured power in places as far apart as modern-day Turkey and modern-day northern India. From there, Islam spread to modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia.

Indeed, it was the later Persian Safavid and Turkish Ottoman empires, neither of which was Arab, out of which the modern Islamic world was carved.

As people converted to Islam, tax revenue dwindled. Abbasid religious authority was also wavering as a more powerful class of religious scholars at the helm of new religious institutions challenged the legitimacy of the system of caliphate.

Ultimately, the highly centralized Abbasid caliphate fragmented into multiple smaller, independent political structures. 

It was perhaps this political decentralization and destabilization that led to the spread of Islam beyond the massive Abbasid empire’s borders. Regional rulers, who did not have to manage such vast territories, were able to expand more fruitfully in single directions. For example, the Fatimids and Berber dynasties in North Africa were able to expand into Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Ghaznavids stretched farther into India.

The Abbasids’ five-century existence finally came to an end with the Mongol sacking of Baghdad in 1258.

### Baghdad
The leaders of the Abbasid Dynasty built Baghdad, the capital of modern-day Iraq. It was located near both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The Abbasids built Baghdad from scratch. Baghdad was strategically located between Asia and Europe, which made it a prime spot on overland trade routes between the two continents. 

In the days of its prosperity the population of Baghdad and its suburbs amounted to over two million.

### Translation Movement
The Abbasid rulers wanted to make Greek texts, such as Aristotle’s works, available to the Arab world. Their goal was to translate as many of these famous works as possible in order to have a comprehensive library of knowledge and to preserve the philosophies and scholarship of Greece. 

One way the Abbasid dynasty was able to spread written knowledge so quickly was their improvements on printing technology they had obtained from the Chinese; some historians believe this technology was taken after the Battle of Talas between the Abbasid Caliphate and the Tang Dynasty in 751. The Chinese had guarded paper making as a secret, but when the Tang lost the battle, the Abbasids captured knowledgeable paper makers as prisoners of war, forcing them to reproduce their craft.

In China, papermaking was a practice reserved for elites, but the Arabs learned how to produce texts on a larger scale, establishing paper mills which made books more accessible. In turn, Europeans eventually learned these papermaking and producing skills from Arabs.
